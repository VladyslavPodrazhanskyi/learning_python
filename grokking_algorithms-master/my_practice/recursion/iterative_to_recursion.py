Converting a loop to recursion in Python involves creating a recursive function that performs the same logic as the original loop. Here's a general approach to convert a loop to recursion:

1) Identify the loop variables and their initial values.
2) Define a recursive function that takes the loop variables as parameters.
3) Move the loop body code into the recursive function.
4) Determine the base case(s) for the recursion and handle them appropriately.
5) Modify the loop variables in each recursive call to mimic the progression of the loop.
6) Make a recursive call to the function with updated loop variables.

Let's illustrate this with an example. Suppose we have a loop that prints numbers from 1 to n:
"""


def print_numbers(n) -> None:
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(i)


def print_numbers_recursion(n: int, i: int = 1) -> None:
    if i <= n:
        print(i)
        print_numbers_recursion(n, i=i+1)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    print_numbers_recursion(5, 1)


"""
By following this general approach, 
you can convert various types of loops into equivalent recursive functions
in Python. However, keep in mind that recursion may have limitations 
in terms of performance and stack depth, 
so it's important to consider the problem's complexity 
and potential resource constraints before opting for a recursive solution.
