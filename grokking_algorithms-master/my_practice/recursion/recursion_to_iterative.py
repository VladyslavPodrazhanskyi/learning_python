Converting a recursive function to a loop in Python
involves restructuring the code to use iterative constructs
such as loops and stacks. Here's a general approach
to convert a recursive function to a loop:

1) Identify the recursive function and its parameters.
2) Create an iterative function or loop structure that mimics the recursive logic.

3) Identify and initialize any necessary variables.
4) Replace the recursive function calls with iterative constructs.
5) Update the necessary variables in each iteration to track the state or progress.
6) Handle the base case(s) appropriately within the loop structure.

Let's demonstrate this with an example of a recursive function
that calculates the factorial of a number:
"""


def factorial_recursive(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)


def factorial_iterative(n):
    pass

# def factorial_iterative(n):
#     result = 1
#     for i in range(1, n + 1):
#         result *= i
#     return result

"""
By following this general approach, 
you can convert recursive functions 
into equivalent loop-based iterative solutions.
Converting recursion to a loop can sometimes improve performance 
and eliminate potential recursion depth limitations. 
However, keep in mind that recursive solutions are often more expressive 
and easier to understand for certain types of problems, 
so the choice between recursion and iteration 
depends on the specific problem and its requirements.
