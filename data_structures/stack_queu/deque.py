"""
The deque class implements a double-ended queue
that supports adding and removing elements
from either end in O(1) time (non-amortized).
Because deques support adding and removing elements
from either end equally well, they can serve both as queues and as stacks.

Pythonâ€™s deque objects are implemented as doubly-linked lists,
which gives them excellent and consistent performance
for inserting and deleting elements but poor O(n) performance
for randomly accessing elements in the middle of a stack.
